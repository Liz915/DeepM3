# DeepM3: Dynamic System-2 Scaling for Recommender Systems

![cover](assets/cover.png)

*Figure: DeepM3 architecture. A continuous-time user dynamics model (System 1)
handles the majority of requests under strict latency constraints, while an
adaptive router selectively escalates uncertain cases to a reasoning agent
(System 2).*

> A hybrid recommender system that combines continuous-time user dynamics (System 1)
> with selective LLM reasoning (System 2), designed for low latency, low cost,
> and stable behavior under real-world traffic.

This repository provides a **fully containerized, reproducible implementation** with built-in monitoring and experiment scripts.

## 📊 Live System Monitoring (Built-in)

DeepM3 ships with a pre-configured Prometheus + Grafana stack.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This design addresses a core production challenge: 
serving the majority of traffic with strict latency budgets,
while preserving reasoning capability for long-tail uncertainty cases.

DeepM3 follows a **System 1 / System 2** cognitive architecture:

1.  **System 1 (Fast Path)**: 
    A Neural ODE model captures continuous-time user trajectories, serving 80%+ of requests with millisecond-level latency.
2.  **System 2 (Slow Path)**: 
    An agent-based reasoning module (DeepSeek-V3) is activated only when uncertainty is detected (e.g., high entropy, multimodal conflicts).
3.  **Adaptive Router**: 
    Dynamically selects between paths to balance accuracy, cost, and system stability.
4.  **Observability**: 
    Native Prometheus & Grafana integration tracks QPS, Tail Latency (P99), and Cache Hit Rates in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Reproducible)

The entire system (API + Prometheus + Grafana) can be deployed with **one command**.  
**No external API key is required** (Runs in Mock Mode by default for zero-cost reproduction).

### 1. Start Services

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Liz915/DeepM3.git](https://github.com/Liz915/DeepM3.git)
cd DeepM3

# Build and start all containers
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 2. Test the API (Usage)
Once started, the API listens at http://localhost:8000.

**Option A : Simple Request (Fast Path)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommend \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user_id":"demo_user", "recent_items":[1,2,3], "recent_times":[0.1,0.2,0.5]}'
```
**Option B : Complex Request (Triggers System 2 Agent)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommend \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "user_id": "vip_user_chaos",
    "recent_items": [10, 500, 5], 
    "recent_times": [0.1, 8.0, 15.2],
    "image_input": "error_stack_trace.png"
}'
```
**Expected Response (Example):**
```json 
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "vip_user_chaos",
    "meta": { 
      "routing_decision": "slow_path", 
      "entropy": 10.0 
    },
    "reasoning_source": "slow_path (System 2)",
    "trace": ["perception", "fusion", "recall", "decision"],
    "recommendations": [
       { "item_id": 1042, "score": 0.98 },
       { "item_id": 503,  "score": 0.95 }
    ]
  },
  "strategy": "Adaptive_ODE_Agent",
  "latency": "0.48ms (API response time, mock mode)"
}
```
> **Note**
> The example requests intentionally trigger the slow path to demonstrate
> System 2 behavior. Under typical traffic, over 80% of requests are served by
> System 1.

**Latency Note**

The reported `latency` refers to the end-to-end API response time measured at
the FastAPI layer.

- In **Mock Mode**, the reasoning module returns immediately (or with optional
  simulated delay), resulting in sub-millisecond latency. This is intentional
  for validating routing logic, caching behavior, and system throughput.
- In **Real Mode**, System 2 latency reflects actual LLM inference time
  (typically ~1–2s), while System 1 remains at millisecond scale.

### 3. Traffic Simulation & Monitoring
To visualize routing behavior and cache dynamics in Grafana, run the traffic generator:
```bash
sh nano_traffic_test.sh
```

**Access Dashboard:**
- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Login: `admin` / `admin`

## 🧪 Reproducibility & Mock Mode
To ensure full reproducibility and avoid external dependencies, DeepM3 runs in Mock Mode by default.

| Mode | Trigger Condition | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Mock Mode** | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is empty | Returns deterministic, structured synthetic responses instantly. Ideal for logic verification and CI/CD. |
| **Real Mode** | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set | Enables live DeepSeek-V3 reasoning. Latency will reflect real-world LLM inference times (~1s). |
## 🔬 Experiments & Benchmarks
All results are reproducible using the scripts in `scripts/experiments/`.

**Key Results**
| Metric | Baseline (All-LLM) | DeepM3 (Ours) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Avg Latency | ~2000 ms | ~408 ms | ⚡ **4.9x Faster** |
| Cost / 1k Req | $5.00 | **$1.80** | 💰 **64% Savings** |
| Routing Acc | N/A | 86.5% | 🎯 **High Precision** |
| JSON Errors | 16.0% | 4.0% | ✅ **DPO Aligned** |
